In the Working with Data category, I satisfied the WD-1 category because I can import data from a variety of formats. Most of our assignments use CSV files, but in practice activity 4, we read in xlsx data using the readxl package and read_xlsx function(practiceactivity4.qmd code chunk1). (WD-2)I can also select the necessary columns from a data set using the select function. I demonstrated this in part a of challenge 3. Also, in challenge 3, I utilized skills in WD-3 when I used the distinct function to get only the rows of distinct subjects in that challenge. Even though I don&rsquo;t have any other examples of removing rows, I am capable of removing rows no matter the data type. You can also use the filter function to select the rows that you want. I demonstrated WD-4 in a screenshot from lab 4. I renamed the avocado codes to avocado names. I also have another screenshot displaying the use of the separate function to restore a date into three new variables. Finally, for WD-4, I include another screenshot converting columns into different variable types. For WD-5, I included a folder called preview, in which I use left and right joins. For WD-6, I pushed screenshots of semi-joins by region. I inputted my data frame of regions and the entire avocado data set. This semi-join removed any regions not included in my data frame. Also, for practice activity 4, I utilized an anti-join to merge two data sets.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for Reproducibility, I demonstrated R-1 and R-2 through challenge 3. I utilized the here package in the first code chunk and throughout the document, I adhered to proper code formatting. Now in terms of R-3, I don&rsquo;t think I have any examples of writing robust programs that are resistant to changes in input. After learning more about functions I am sure I will have more examples to include. For example, I could use the stopifnot function to make sure my arguments are a certain data type.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Data visualization, I satisfied the DVS-1 condition because I used scatterplots and histograms. An example of this is in challenge 3 when I utilized histograms and fill to show the difference in the average number of artists liked per genre by ethnicity. To satisfy the DVS-2 condition I also used my histogram from challenge 3 because I effectively used the x and y axis to label my plots. For DVS-3, I demonstrated this skill in Challenge 2 because I modified the colors for each genus by manually changing the color using the color pallet tool. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For PE-1, I believe that my lab assignments demonstrate this skill because I try not to reuse function calls. You can specifically look at challenge 3 and lab 2. As far as PE-3, we haven&rsquo;t gone into looping yet, but I believe I demonstrate this in lab 4 when I use the across function. The function loops through the columns and calculates the mean for each column independently(This example is in a snapshot named PE-3). This skill also goes hand in hand with DVS-4 because it creates a numerical summary of the means for each of the avocado groups. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I am struggling to keep up with the assignments, I do my absolute best to stay up on material and prepare for class every day. To be honest, I am having a tough time balancing stat 330, CSC 203, and water polo on top of this class. I want to catch up this week before we meet on Friday if not by this weekend. We had regionals this past weekend and have nationals November 11-13. I will have to miss class next Thursday so I must catch up. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;As far as group work, I feel that I am growing as a team member by collaborating well with my team. Also, occasionally group members from other groups join our table. It is nice to collaborate with more classmates. I also like that our group is very friendly and we are not afraid or shy to collaborate. As a team member, I want to improve by getting my lab assignments done on time so I can better prepare for classes and assist my teammates in class.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I believe I am only missing PE-4, R-3, and DVS-5 from my work. As I catch up and revise my other assignments, I think that I can demonstrate my proficiency in all of these skills. At this point in the class, I think that I am in the b- to c+ range because I have been falling behind. &nbsp;I also need to stay up to date on my peer reviews and give better feedback every week. I also want to spend more time working on figuring out new functions to improve my graphing and visualization skills. I am excited to learn more about R in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
