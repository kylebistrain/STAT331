In the Working with Data category, I have achieved WD-1 category because I can import data from a variety of formats. In most of our assignments we use csv files, but in practice activity 4 read in xlsx data using the readxl package and read_xlsx function. (WD-2)I also can also select the necessary columns from a data set using the select function. I demonstrated this in part a of challenge 3. Also in challenge 3, I utilized skills in WD-3 when I used the distinct function to get only the rows of distinct subjects in that challenge. Even though I don&rsquo;t have any other examples of removing rows, I am capable of removing rows no matter the data type. You can also use the filter function to select the rows that you want to keep. For skill WD-4 I demonstrated this in a screenshot from lab 4. I renamed the avocado codes to avocado names. I also have another screenshot demonstrating the use of the separate function to restore a date into three new variables. And finally for WD-4, I include another screenshot converting columns into different variable types. For WD-5, I include a folder called preview in which I use left and right joins. For WD-6 I included screenshots of semi-joins by region. I inputted in my data frame of regions and the entire avocado data set. This semi join removed any regions not included in my data frame. Also for practice activity 4, I utilized an anti join to merge two data sets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for Reproducibility, I demonstrated R-1 and R-2 through challenge 3. This challenge assignment utilized the here package and is clean quarto document. Also, the code is tidy and follows proper formatting rules. Now in terms of R-3, I don&rsquo;t think I have any examples of writing robust programs that are resistant to changes in input.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Data visualization, I satisfied the DVS-1 condition because I have used scatterplots and histograms. An example of this is in challenge 3 when I utilized histograms and fill to show the difference in the average number of artists liked per genre by ethnicity. To satisfy the DVS-2 condition I also used my histogram from challenge 3 because I effectively used x and y axis to label my plots. For DVS-3, I demonstrated this skill in Challenge 2 because I modified the colors for each genus by manually changing the color using the color pallet tool. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For PE-1, I believe that all of my lab assignments demonstrate this skill because I try not to reuse function calls. You can specifically look at challenge 3 and lab 2. As far as PE-3, we haven&rsquo;t gone into looping yet, but I believe I demonstrate this in lab 4 when I use the across function. I am looping through each column that I select and am calculating the mean for each column. This skill also goes hand in hand with DVS-4 because it creates a numerical summary of the means for each of the avocado groups. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I am struggling to keep up with the assignments, I make sure to catch up on the material and prepare for class everyday. To be honest, I am having a tough time balancing my other classes and I really want to improve and manage my time better. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;As far as group work, I feel that I am growing as a team member by collaborating well with my team. I also like that our group is very friendly and we are not afraid or shy to collaborate. As a team member, I want to improve by getting my lab assignments done on time so I can better prepare for classes and assist my teammates in class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I believe I am only missing PE-4 , R-3, and DVS-5 from my work. As I catch up and revise my other assignments, I think that I can demonstrate my proficiency in all of these skills. At this point in the class, I think that I am in the b- to c+ range because I do my best to complete all the class assignments on time, but I have been falling behind recently. I also am staying up to date on my peer reviews and am getting better at giving feedback every week. I would like to improve my time management skills because it is easy to fall behind. I also want to spend more time working figuring out new functions to improve my graphing and visualization skills. I am excited to learn more about R in the last couple weeks of the quarter. </span></p></body></html>
